FPost FESOM2.0 Postprocessing Tool
----------------------

A tool for postprocessing the output from the Finite Element Sea Ice-Ocean Model (FESOM). It performs different diagnostics with FESOM output, such as computing transports, vorticity etc. on an native grid and interpolates them onto a desired regular mesh. FESOM output compatible with v2.0 is supported.

-------------------------
1. Compile
-------------------------

FPost has been successfully tested with different Intel FORTRAN Compilers available on several platforms. It requires netcdf library to be installed and no version dependency has been noticed.


-------------------------
2. Running FPost in two steps
-------------------------

2.1 Set namelist.interp appropriately
FPost is controlled via namelist.interp file which is placed in the root folder of the tool. 
   Section 'config' describes the specifics of the run the user wants to postprocess. 
   Section 'todo' contains the list of required diagnostics. This list will be permanently updated throughout the further development of the code. 
   Section 'fesom_mesh' contains the specifics of the native mesh which was used to run FESOM. 
   Section 'regular_mesh' describes the desired regular mesh onto which the diagnostics shall be interpolated. o2r_filename is the name of the interpolant. 
           It is the full name of the file which is placed in the root folder of FPost if not the full path is provided.

2.2 Just run FPost and keep in mind, that 
    2.2.1 do_mesh=.true. shall be made only once unless you do not modify 'regular_mesh' or 'fesom_mesh' namelist sections in between!
    2.2.2 specify different names for interpolants for different settings to avoid computing it again. It might be time consuming
    2.2.3 you may always contact Dmitry.Sidorenko@awi.de who will be happy to help you further if you are stuck with FPost

Have a nice day!
   
News:
06.01.2017 Computation of AMOC etc. is now supported via using mask option in the namelist.interp. The mask file needs to be specified.
06.01.2017 do_TS3 option for interpolating hydrography has been added to namelist.interp
